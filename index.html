      <p>Albert Einstein said: “The important thing is to not stop questioning;
        curiosity has its own reason for existing." In this day and age of rapid technological advancement,
        this statement takes a new dimension.</p>
        <p>Born in 2017 from the vivid imagination of composer and musician Mynah Marie, Earth To Abigail
        strives to redefine more traditional genres of music by intergrating new mediums of expression
        such as Live Coding and DIY instrument making as well as using loops and samples. The goal is to use technology to
        recreate a full experience for the audience while being alone on stage.
        Curiosity is the main motivator in the making of Earth To Abigail. It is a musical playground as well as a laboratory
        to experiment with technology through sounds in the hopes of communicating this curiosity to everyone experiencing the music.

    <p>Mynah Marie has been living the life of a nomad for the past 15 years. Her past work as a musician
    led her to collaborate with an impressive variety of artists, from Mexico with the latin fusion band Casa Verde Colectivo
    to India with the bollywood singer Arijit Singh or Israel with Din Din Aviv with stops in France, Italty, Spain, California,
    Nepal and Egypt along the way.</p>
  <p>The necessity of creating a project that could give her the creative freedom of a solo performer without feeling limited
    from the boundaries of being alone on stage was precisely derived from the nomadic way of life.
    Inspired by her newly aquired passion for coding and programming, Mynah wanted bring into her new project
    elements that could transcend the music to open conversations about the place of technology
    in our lives today and how we use it.
